You need to think about compliance

Organisations have compliance, if they don't follow it, they have to pay large penalties, it may also be your job to make things run in a compliant manner and ensures that everyone follows it, and make sure that people follow it

If they aren't aware, then they won't follow it unless they accidentally cause something.

When you are doing some security assessment, the procedure and see if there is any fall and how to improve it.

E.g. ID card and who can access what.

Document it all and find the documentation, so request it.

Are people actually following procedure or just being silly goobers

if you find gaps, you can see attacks that can happen, show them about that and they'll be aware.
