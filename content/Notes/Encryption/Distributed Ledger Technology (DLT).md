>DLT is a [[Decentralise|decentralised]] system (Which eliminates the need for central authority) of protocols and technology that allows multiple [[Node|nodes]] in different locations to propose, validate and update [[Transaction in blockchains|transactions]] across a network. **They're synchronised and maintained in a shared distributed database that exists across various locations to ensure transparency and security**, all transactions and records in the DLT are [[Timestamp|timestamped]] and given a unique cryptographic signature (Hash) making it essentially unencryptable for the time being (until quantum computing properly comes along lol)

To summarise it, DLT is basically a distributed database, spanning across multiple sites geographically and is not stored, validated or governed by any one person, it's open and transparent!

Despite decentralised in nature, when the implementer of DLT has greater control over how it is actually implemented

[[Contributor of BTC (If I remember correctly) who stole 3 billion from the silk road]]


^ Basically that shit is essneitally saying the developers have control how it's implemented, during the silk road, one of the original developers of BTC was able to make a leak through the silk road in which he funneled 100s of millions of dollars, (he was caught by the FBI though in the end)

Distributed ledgers are mostly permissioned databases

DLT is very similar to the (blockchain)

Unlike Blockchain, DLT doesn't necessarily require having a data structure (like the block thing with the previous hash) in blocks.
