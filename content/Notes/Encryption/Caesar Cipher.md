Caesar cipher is an algorithm that creates [[Ciphertext]].

It moves each letter of the [[Plaintext|plaintext]] forwards or backwards in the alphabet by N.

**If you are at A or Z, it wraps back around.**

So if the message is 'izak' and we're moving it forward by 3 what would it be?

It'd be lcdn.

I - j, k, **L**
<br>
Z - a, b, **C**
<br>
A - b, c, **D**
<br>
K - l, m, **N**
<br>
This is a simple [[Substitution Cipher]]

Additional information, it was named after a roman soldier Julius Caesar from 100-44 BC and used it during the Gallic Wars to communicate with allies and hide communications from the enemy.
