1. **First thing that happens is the transactions are stored inside the first block dependent on the type of blockchain**
2. **Hash is then calculated per block with a unique identity of that block to maintain security and integrity and to be aware if any changes have been made**
3. **Finally, the previous hash is included per block to create a chain of blocks (In the name, blockchain XD) and provide tamper proof security, which is vital to stop people from exploiting it.**

(cool fact) First ever block is known as genesis block which didn't have any previous hash value and therefore is considered zero.

Blockchain is always a sequence 
Blockchain is a type of DLT and duplicated and distributed across the entire network since it's distributed via nodes and other PC systems.


Hash is to check and insure the integrity of data

You want to check whether your data is in check or not, is it modified, in transit or? You can always determine by checking the hash value
One thing is clear: If something changes, a SINGLE bit! In that block of data, the hash will be completely different (COOL  AS ANYTHING!)
It will tell you if it is clear or not

previous and normal, why are we doing them together?
It's very simple, any hash from previous block will become the previous hash of the next block

DLT is super robust and secure, how? let's say a hacker or threat actor wants to modify the block.

Blockchain has got thousands of blocks, you can change the hash run

once you change hash 1, this hash is going to effect another hash, it'll effect the value the other block, and then the next one, and the next, AND THE NEXT, ANNMNNDD THE NEXTTTT (and so on)

So it'll affect the entire blockchain since you're passing the previous hash to the next block. It's a domino effect and it seems to be extremely secure

Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions and every time a new transaction occurs, a record is added to everybody's ledger in the form of a new block.

Again, timestamped and (immutable) (cryptographic) signatures called a hash.

Blockchains use a consensus algorithm

The records cannot be changed unless all those are verifying the transaction agree to the changes. It cannot be manipulated. Makes it highly secure and vastly less susceptible to attacks than centralised networks.

If you're confused:

I'm assuming that the previous hash is modifying the next block similar to (X) encryption

A public blockchain should be open, neutral, censorship resistant and borderless.

Blockchain is a sequence whereas DLT doesn't require data structures in blocks

blockchains are public anyone can view it. Whereas DLT which has some restrictions on who can use and access it and who can operate as a nodes
Summary, blockchain is a type of DLT, but DLT is not neccessarily a blockchain (What?)

Doesn't matter if you went for the last block, if it's important it's hard to go on the last block, they need access and info on the blockchain, they can't just go on the last block, we need to have some basic info on that looks straightforward on a diagram, but different in reality.


Cool as fuck features of blockchain:

You can change it, but it requires validation (immutiable) so needs consensus
