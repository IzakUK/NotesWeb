<p style="text-align:center">It's a data structure used to keep a set of transactions (It can have 5 10 15 transactions together, that's how we write it in block, how many in blocks? it depends)</p>


A block is a data structure used to store groups of [[Transaction in blockchains|transactions]]. Each block contains a set number of transactions, which could be 5, 15 or more, depending on the specific blockchain protocol and the size of the [[Transaction in blockchains|transaction]].

Blocks are the building blocks of blockchain, each of these contain [[Transaction in blockchains|transaction]] data, [[Timestamp|a timestamp]], and a unique identifier. They're linked in a [[Chain|chain]], making a secure and [[Immutiable|immutable]] ledger.

The number of [[Transaction in blockchains|transactions]] vary based on the rules and the [[Transaction in blockchains|transaction]] sizes. Each block will be capped by a size limit to ensure the network remains effective and that blocks are processed in a reasonable timeframe
