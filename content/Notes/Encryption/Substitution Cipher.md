It creates [[Ciphertext|ciphertext]] using the alphabet like [[Caesar Cipher|caesar cipher]] does.

Instead of moving the entire alphabet, it moves it with a case-by-case algorithm

Let's take my name, izak and use this with our custom substitution cipher
<br>
A = 8
B = I
C = R
D = V
E = O
F = L
... (fillers, you get the idea)
I = X
K = ?
Z = ะด
<br>
It'd make Xะด8?
<br>
I = X
Z = ะด
A = 8
K = ?
<br>
It's a letter by letter replacement method.
