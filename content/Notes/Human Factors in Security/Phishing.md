Phishing attacks are attacks where the deception is used to lure a victim into revealing sensitive information that can be used to gain access.

Individual users aren't the only ones susceptible to this attack, organisations can fall victim to this which could lead to major vital breaches.

These attacks tend to be generic, easy to spot. But there's a more sinister version... One that many people and organisations have nightmares about. Difficult to spot, deceptive as anything and most of all, extremely dangerous dependant on the skill level.


It's called... Spear Phishing.
