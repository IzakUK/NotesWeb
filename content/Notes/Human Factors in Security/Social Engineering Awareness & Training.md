Dependant upon if you're in a big company or a small one, the methodology will be different

Some organisations may have large scale training, while others have small.

if you want to demonstrate you stood the module, some of the ideas you can put ^ some of this you can put in your writing and went through and understood

There are two main attitudes towards training.

[[Reactive]]
[[Proactive]]

Proactive: Prevention of something possibly bad happening
