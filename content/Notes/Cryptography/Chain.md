<p style="text-align:center">Sequence of blocks in a <b>specific order.</b></p>

You maintain the order due to the structure of hash with the previous blocks, one thing changed, the entire thing does. It's vital (like a chain on a bike, "if it ain't right, it don't work")

<p style="text-align:center">Each block holds value to the previous, if one gets changed, the entire thing does</p>
