A node is a computer, in this case, like a cog in a larger network. **It's a connection along many network devices and can be any type of internet device (like a switch, laptop or phone)**

In blockchain (Nodes will host [[Distributed Ledger|ledgers]] and [[Smart Contracts]] where [[Transaction in blockchains]] are executed and validated in distributed)

The device can receive and send data from one device to another.

Note: A node can only perform different roles depending on the type of blockchain (e.g. a fill node can be a super node) :D 

Types of nodes you may see in blockchains:

>[[Full Node]]

>[[Super Node]]

>[[Light Node]]

>**[[Member Node]]**

>**[[Validator Node]]**

>**[[Mining Node]]**

>[[Node Application]]

In different block chains, you don't need to have all of these, different ones for different blockchain
