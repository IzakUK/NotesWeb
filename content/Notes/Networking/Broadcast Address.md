Broadcast address, which is at the end of the [[Subnet Mask]] at 255, essentially is used to communicate between all devices on a network

Fun example:


Device: "Hey, CAN SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING???"

*Sends a broadcast address to the DHCP server*

the 23 devices on the network:

 "HALLO, HALLO, HALLO!!!! :DDDD"
(obviously it'll only be one request and it'll be the DHCP server)

It replies with all included IP addresses assigned to the different addresses



Cool diagram for it:
