When you are designing this, you can think of foundational training and awareness, you might need individual awareness and training, in foundation l it'll cover all the generic and basic for all the people within the organisation

When it comes to department, you need to focus on specific it would be very focus on their job role or daily activities and invidiaul awareness and training it'll be for specific people, some people have access to CCTV or one person who has access, training for that person and the specific job role it can also be applied to the CEO as they are highly demanding individual and are a high target, so they might have a speciialised training program.


As an ICT expert you don't think you need to do this, but the project people have the budget, you need to look after the budget, when you're planning and training, you need to talk to the management as they approve it, it may be frustrating as you don't have the power, but it is the process, you need approoval of management otherwise you can't really do anything, your duty to convince them why it's important, useful and needed.
