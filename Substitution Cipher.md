It's using the alphabet like [[Caesar Cipher|caesar cipher]].

Instead of moving the entire alphabet, it moves it with a case-by-case algorithm

Let's take my name, izak and use this with our custom substitution cipher

A = 8
B = I
C = R
D = V
E = O
F = L
...
I = X
K = ?
Z = ะด

It'd make Xะด8?

I = X
Z = ะด
A = 8
K = ?

It's a letter by letter replacement method.
