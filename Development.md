Staff can contact the hepl desk to get a pass reset for their email

and you need to decide where to use this in a scenario and what topic it'll cover, where it'll cover, if it's only for a few people then put it in a specific department.

What happens if they don't have in their password, pass rules, GHCQ have a password list of common passwords for organisations to use for good rules.

It should be short, informative, for workshops and hands-on presentations to follow the social engineers and how they may attepmt to gain access to their email and how social engineers may attempt to trick the user into revealing their pass, covering telephone techniques and malicious website.

In case of departmental trainnig you ned to identify one of thier job roles

In this case, you need to think of hte common material and when you are doing training material, don't look for common ones, but look aware of their specific privileges and how they could be leveraged. So focus on highly privileged departments like management or supervisors.

After you've given training, you need to be mindful on the impact

After they have the training, the atttack should be less

hte more you provide them examples relevant to their job, the less the attacks will happen
